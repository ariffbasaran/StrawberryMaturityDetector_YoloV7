The project "StrawberryMaturityDetector" describes an image processing and artificial intelligence-based application that utilizes YOLOv7 to automatically detect ripe and unripe strawberries. In this project, advanced object recognition technology is employed to swiftly and accurately determine the ripeness levels of strawberries. This provides a valuable tool for optimizing the harvesting time of strawberries and enhancing product quality. The project is built upon processing data obtained from Kaggle and training the model using Roboflow.
